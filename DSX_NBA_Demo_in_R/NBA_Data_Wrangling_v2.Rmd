# Custom Feature Explanation

> After building my initial model, I noticed that the logistic model was adjusting the probabilities well at the end of the games. I had some examples where I had 0 time left in the game, and yet the logistic model was giving a 70% chance of victory for a team. I speculated this was due to the fact that my original features were not fitting the end of game very well. To fix this, I created a spreader custom feature that basically takes the score difference and amplifies it as the score nears the end of the game. This way this feature is very predictive at the end of games and can help adjust the probablities to be more certain at the end of games.



# Show effect of custom spreader feature 
```{r, out.width = 'auto'}
# subset a dataframe for scatterplot
spreader <- filter(rtscoresDF, pct_complete < 95)

# draw interactive scatter plot
scatterD3(x = spreader$pct_complete, y = spreader$scoreb_scorea, col_var = spreader$key)

# Inspect Odds Data
> How to Read the Raw Odds data


    
    Example Golden State -12.5 O (207.0) -125.0 | Detroit 12.5 U (207.0) 145.0
    The away team is listed first, and the home team is second
    Here Golden State is a 12.5 pt favorite to win.  The over under is in parentheses (207) and is the 50/50 line between teams sum of scores
    being above/below that line.  
    Finally the -125 / +145 numbers are whats known at the moneyline odds. 
        A negative number means you need to bet 125$ to get a 100$ payout
        A positive number means you need to bet 100$ to get a 145$ payout
